# Gear {#gear}

Despite their prowess, **[Cazadores](#cazadores)** are ultimately human. Their bodies are honed instruments of the **Hunt**, but they must still rely on an assortment of **[Weapons](#gear-weapons)**, **[Armour](#gear-armour)**, and **[Special Gear](#special-gear)** to overcome their **[Foes](#foes)**. Cazadores rely on these tools of the Hunt to such a degree that they trade and stake their reputations and **[Renown](#renown)** to ensure the **[Pack](#pack)** is properly equipped. 


Each Cazador or **[Companion](#companion-types)**, may be equipped with up to 3 Weapons, 1 Armour, and 2 Special Gear. Cazadores know that bringing more into the Hunt is simply too cumbersome and therefore carries too great a risk to oneâ€™s life.
