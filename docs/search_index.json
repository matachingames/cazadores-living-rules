Inspiration This game is built upon the innovations, thrills, and genius of a host of other games and pieces of media. To the best of the author’s abilities, connections between this game and these various works are drawn in Appendix N. Please seek out and explore these other works. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Appendix N Every good idea here likely came from some other game, directly or via inspiration. If you find my little game even remotely interesting, here are other games you should check out: Perilous Tales by Planet Smasher Games: The source for the wonderful d10 pool mechanic used to resolve everything in this game. World of Warcraft Miniatures Game: For its ingenious time mechanic that makes its way here to make the combat feel dynamic. The Dolorous Stroke by Dying Stylishly: The game that set the perspective for narrative gaming present here. It’s Hit Location deck also inspired the Adversary Deck system. Rangers of Shadow Deep by Joseph McCulloch: I think the game that sets the bar for solo games of this type. Worth every bit of your time. Hunters of the First Blood by Aegeos Game: A game that made it clear that if I could bring half its flavor to my own game, I’d be happy. It’s also the source for the Areas term and usage. Sengokou Monster Hunter: A great monster hunting game set in feudal japan. Additionally, there are multiple sources of inspiration for this game: movies, video games, and other things. Here are a few: Bloodborne and the Dark Souls series of video games The Berserk Manga The Monster Hunter series, specially Monster Hunter World. Hunt: Showdown video game Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) film Changelog v.03 General An Introduction has been added! Wording clarification throughout. Addition of Hostile and Friendly under “Models &amp; Scale”. Addition of Place as a game term under “Overlapping”. Criticals now still count as Successes even when used to activate an Ability. Goodbye Nerve! (for now): Nerve has been removed from the game and is instead subsumed under Wounds. Nerve added an additional level of fiddliness to the game (e.g., requiring codifying Terror Defence), when it didn’t add much to enjoyment. Terror Ratings are still in place and Foes still Terror Attacks, which function the same way (DT Target Fortitude), but it’s clarified that most often the victim gains the Terrified Condition, with WNDs reserved for rarer cases. Terror now also functions as Foes’ Skill for clearing Conditions, so it better mirrors Fortitude, opening design space for high DEF “hard to crack” Foes that are susceptible to Conditions (e.g., Burning, etc.) due to low Terror Ratings. Introduction of “else” and clarification on how to resolve Foes’ Decision Trees. Combat Parry has been changed to only affect Melee Attacks. Tick cost increased to 4. Wording clarification that the Attack from a successful Parry can only be directed at the Model’s Target for the Parry action. Hide Tick cost increased to 3. Model must now also be within 1” of Obscuring or Blocking Terrain. Wording clarification that DT is equal to the highest Hostile ATK within 3”. Hidden Condition clarified that a Model with this Condition can still be hit by Area attacks and other effects that do not explicitly require it to be the Target of the Action. Condition now also expires at the end of the Round. Defenceless Condition changed so that the Attacker no longer gains Advantage on Attacks against the affected Model. Weapons and Gear Introduction of Readied instead of Equipped Weapon to determine which Weapons can be used in an Attack. Models can carry 3 Weapons into a Hunt although only 1 Weapon per “hand” can be Readied. Includes addition of “Dual Wielding” and clarification that only Abilities and Critical Effects on Readied Weapons have an effect in play. Introduced the concept of Special Gear and the Max 2 limitation for further customization of Models. Introduction of the Use Gear Action alongside Gear that have special effects in game. Armor was a little too good in the previous iteration so the Renown cost for Medium and Heavy Armor has been increased. Rituals Addition of Rituals into game, clarification of Max 3 Rituals, including how their effects function in-game. Narrative Rules Objectives added into the game! v.04 General Introduced a d100 roll under Other Rolls. Overlapping Rules have been changed so that Friendly Models can no overlap while moving to make it easier to traverse the battlefield. The keyword Vessel has been changed to Passive to open design space for its usage in more cases. Actions Other Actions have been renamed to Special Actions. Added a Pass Action to codify what happens when a Model chooses not to take an Action. Cover Ground Action has had its Tick Cost increased to 3. Additionally, on success, the Model can move up to 1x SPD + 1” per Success. It’s also been clarified that on failure, the Model cannot move at all from this Action. Added some rules to deal with Climbing, Falling, and other aspects of Situational Movement. Objectives Objective-specific Gear has been made less scarce, since it made completing objectives unnecessary difficult (since at least one Pack Model will be defeated during a Hunt in most games). Distances between multiple Objectives reduced for Retrieve the Icon and Forge the Seal from 5 to 3\". "],["1-hunterintro.html", "1 Book of The Hunter 1.1 The Game 1.2 The World", " 1 Book of The Hunter 1.1 The Game Cazadores is a narrative-focused miniatures game that can be played solo or cooperatively with up to 4 players. It only requires 1-4 miniatures per side and a 24” x 24” space, making it a great “kitchen table” game and introduction to the hobby. Each player creates a Cazador, a brave and formidable hunter hellbent on defeating fearsome mythical beasts, twisted beings, uncanny horrors, and other terrifying Adversaries. Cazadores are joined by a rare few Companions willing to follow them into the wilderness, through the desert, across mountains, and into the lairs of monstrous things and the darkness between the planes. Narrative Gaming Cazadores approaches miniatures gaming with a slightly different perspective than traditional wargames. At its core, the game is more interested in helping you tell stories about dynamic encounters between your unique Cazadores and frightening Foes than ensuring there is a careful gameplay balance and highly codified rules more conducive to competitive wargaming. In some ways Cazadores owes just as much as to tabletop role-playing games as it does to other narrative wargames like Necromunda, Mordheim, Inquisitor, Rangers of Shadow Deep, and The Dolorous Stroke. When you play Cazadores, I urge you to: Act as best fits your characters than to eke out an optimal outcome. Resolve ambiguous situations in the way that is most dramatically satisfying. The rules are a framework to expand and improvise. Play to find out what happens rather than play to win. Using These Books Cazadores is divided into three books for ease of use at the table. The Hunter, the book you are reading now, has everything you need to know to play the game and create your Cazadores and Companions. The Adversary has the information for the antagonists that stand against your Pack. The Eternal Hunt contains rules and tables to link Hunts together into campaigns. 1.2 The World The world of Cazadores is, purposefully, a bundle of vague ideas rather than a detailed setting. It’s a world that never was, inspired by the greek myths and cautionary children’s tales that lived in my grandfather’s library. It’s all those stories seen through older eyes looking for escapism, excitement, and terrors that can be confronted by the bravest among us. You can choose to incorporate these bits of lore and details seeded throughout the text as you see fit. In Cazadores, the world is brimming with danger and you’ll find that an undertone of horror courses through nearly all of the writing. You do not need to focus on this if you’re not interested in that or if you’re playing with others who might be too young or not amenable to this approach to the game. The Hunt The Hunt is the tradition spanning centuries that is the impetus for the game. It is not honoured or glorified. It is often viewed as necessary, if despicable. Your game might take place during the Bronze Age, Medieval Era, something akin to Victorian England, or any other time. The Hunt will be ever present. At its base, the game assumes a time similar to the 17th or 18th century of our own world, with a few severe anachronisms thrown in. There are flowing capes, masquerades, grand literary and scientific achievements and more all alongside plated armours, portable explosives, unnatural magicks, and the terrors of the Hunt. The Cazadores Cazadores, the masters of the Hunt, are not always considered heroes, though they are eminent. Their ranks are made of the zealous, the honour-bound, the torchbearers of familial tradition, and those desperate souls with no other means to survive in the world. Covenants bind them to each other and dictate how and why they Hunt, but just as many are unbound and run loose like wolves on the prowl. The Adversaries Creatures of legend and incredible power, though not all malevolent. They are sometimes the remnants of ages eclipsed by the rise of humanity, and sometimes the vanguards of a new era that will eventually erase our kind from history. Their kind spans artificial constructs to celestial beings. "],["2-overview.html", "2 Overview 2.1 What You Need To Play 2.2 Models &amp; Scale 2.3 Measurement 2.4 Overlapping, Placement, &amp; Pushing", " 2 Overview 2.1 What You Need To Play Cazadores is played on a small Play Area (24” x 24”) with groups of 1-4 Models per side. In addition to Models, you will need: Terrain to bring the Play Area to life. A handful of 10-sided dice (d10s). 10 d10s one of color. 2 d10s of a different color. 1 standard 52-card deck of playing cards for the Adversary Deck. Tape measure or ruler in inches. Tokens to track Conditions. Model sheets (from Cazadores on itch.io), pencil, and paper clips. Throughout, some words are bolded and capitalized (eg., Adversary) to indicate they are game terms with specific rules. Bolding only occurs the first time a term appears in a chapter. 2.2 Models &amp; Scale Models refer to miniature figures used to represent the various characters in the game. These rules are written with 28mm scale Models in mind, although play with smaller Models is possible by measuring using centimetres instead of inches. The players’ Models, the Cazadores, are the protagonists of the game, unique characters with special equipment and abilities to hunt down monstrous beasts and confront other dangers. Cazadores are joined by Companions, Models representing supporting characters. Foes are made up of Models depicting creatures, human and otherwise, that oppose the Cazadores. Importantly, minor Foes are referred to as Minions, while the major Foe in a Hunt is the Adversary. Adversaries are usually represented by larger and more imposing Models than other Foes. The rules also refer to Hostile and Friendly Models to clarify if some in-game effects, such as Area effects, only apply to some Models. Cazadores and Companions are Friendly to each other and Hostile to Foes. Foes are Friendly to each other and Hostile to Cazadores and Companions. 2.3 Measurement All distances in the game are measured in inches. When measuring, always: Make movement measurements from the same edge of the Model’s base throughout the move. Use the closest points between two objects when measuring the distance between them. Players can choose to measure distances at any point. Line of Sight Line of Sight (LOS) is used to determine if Models can see each other for the purposes of any Action. When determining LOS, imagine a cylinder that extends from the base of the unit up to its eyeline. Models can draw LOS from any point in 360° around this imaginary cylinder. A Model has LOS to another if it can draw a straight line from any part of its cylinder to another without crossing any Blocking Terrain or Hostile Models. LOS is always reciprocal so that if a Model can claim to have LOS of another, the other Model is also considered to have LOS back. 2.4 Overlapping, Placement, &amp; Pushing Models’ bases cannot overlap with one another at any point. The only exception is that Models may briefly overlap with other Friendly Models when taking a Movement Action, however, they still cannot end their Turn overlapping any other Model. Sometimes Models would be forced to overlap due to an in-game effect, such as a Model being pushed away due to an Attack and being forced to move into another. In these cases, any Models in the way may be moved directly back by the minimum amount necessary to make space for the affected Model. If a Model is pushed into Impassable Terrain the Model stops moving when its base comes into contact with the terrain, and any other Models being pushed into this Model also stop. Occasionally, a Model might be picked up and Placed somewhere else on the board, perhaps due to being grabbed and thrown. In these cases simply lift the Model up and place it down at its final position. If other Models must be moved to accommodate for this, use the overlapping guidelines above. "],["3-basics.html", "3 The Basics 3.1 Core Mechanics 3.2 Actions, Ticks, &amp; Clocks 3.3 Terrain Types 3.4 Cazadores &amp; Companions 3.5 Foes", " 3 The Basics 3.1 Core Mechanics Checks The central mechanic in the game is referred to as a Check and is used to determine the result of a Model’s Actions. Checks are made with a pool of d10s equal to the Model’s Rating in the relevant Skill plus its linked Attribute (e.g., Melee Checks use a dice pool composed of a number of d10s equal to the Model’s Melee Rating plus their Prowess Rating). If a Model does not have a relevant Skill Rating for the Check, then it makes the Check using only the associated Attribute Rating. To this pool, you always add the Difficulty Die (1d10 of a different color). All of the dice are rolled together, any die that rolls equal to or higher than the value of the Difficulty Die is considered a Success. A single Success is often all that is required for a Model to accomplish their Action. If a Model fails a Check, they do nothing else but can still execute their free Move Action if it’s available. Targets &amp; Difficulty Thresholds To simulate the difficulty involved in some Checks, like hitting a moving Target with a Shooting Attack, the game employs Difficulty Thresholds (DT). Difficulty Thresholds are a minimum value that the dice rolled must equal or exceed to be considered a Success beyond the value rolled on the Difficulty Die. The DT might be a fixed value (e.g., DT 5) or it might refer to the value for one of the Target’s Ratings (e.g., DT Target DEF). During a Check, the Difficulty Die might come up as greater than the DT for any Check. If so, it overrides the DT to determine the value the dice must equal. For example, if a Model attempts a Shooting Attack against a Target, the Target’s attempt to protect itself using its Defence is treated as a DT (e.g., DEF of 6, sets DT to 6). Dice rolled must be equal to or greater than 6 at minimum to be considered Successes. Criticals &amp; Abilities Any die rolled that results in a 10 (presented as “0” on some dice) is considered a Critical. Criticals can be used to activate Abilities, such as those present on some Gear. A Critical used in this manner still counts as a Success. Each Critical can only be used once to activate an Ability and each Ability can only be activated once per Turn. However, if a roll has multiple Criticals these can be used to activate multiple Abilities. The effects of an Ability always occur before the rest of the Action is resolved but only if the Check is a success, otherwise Criticals cannot take effect. Advantage &amp; Disadvantage Maneuvers and situational factors in the game can result in Advantage or Disadvantage for the Model. If a model has Advantage, roll two Difficulty Dice for the relevant Skill Check and discard the highest result, then determine Successes. If a Model has Disadvantage, roll two Difficulty Dice and discard the lowest result. Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out at one to one, so if a Model has two instances of Advantage and one of Disadvantage, they end up with a single instance of Advantage. A Model cannot “stack” Advantages or Disadvantages. Whether a Model has one or three of either doesn’t change that only two Difficulty Dice can ever be rolled. Other Rolls Sometimes the game requires that you roll a d5. To do so, roll a d10 and treat a 1-2 as 1, 3-4 as 2, and so on. One example of this use is the Scatter Roll. To make a Scatter Roll, roll a d5 to determine a random distance and direction. Treat the “point” on the die that is off the surface of the Play Area as indicating the direction of the scatter and the numerical value as the distance. Then, on the Play Area, measure the distance from the Model or token being scattered in the direction determined by the die to find the new position for that Model or token. Additionally, you might also be asked to roll a d100 to determine a random result on some tables, such as for Scars. To do so, simply roll 2d10s and treat one of the dice as the tens and the other as the ones to obtain a result between 1 and 100. 3.2 Actions, Ticks, &amp; Clocks The Cost of Action Cazadores are driven by boundless bravery and unshakeable resolve, while the Adversary and its Minions possess unnatural strength and fearsome power. Neither are limited by their stamina or endurance during the Hunt. Instead, all Actions take precious time, represented as Ticks. Moments of furious struggle are demarcated by Ticks on the Round Clock. A tracker with 10 Ticks that advances throughout the game. Each Model possesses a Personal Clock which tracks the next Tick on which they can act. During a Model’s Turn, when it attempts an Action, the Model must first pay the Action’s Ticks, advancing their Personal Clock by that amount. Once it has carried out its Actions, the Model will not be able to take another Turn until the Round Clock matches their Personal Clock again. For example, a Model with a Personal Clock at Tick 1 makes a Melee Attack. First, it advances its Personal Clock by the Attack Action’s Ticks (3), bringing its clock to Tick 4. Then, regardless of the outcome of the Attack, it cannot take another Turn until the Round Clock is at Tick 4. Ticks, Clocks, and the Flow of Time The Round Clock only advances once all eligible Models take a Turn during a Tick. Once it reaches Tick 10 and would advance, instead the Round ends. At this point all Conditions and other effects that take effect at the end of the Round are resolved and the Round Clock is reset to Tick 1. Unlike the Round Clock, Personal Clocks do not reset, instead they “loop”. If a Model’s Personal Clock is at Tick 9 and it takes an Action of 3 Ticks, then it’s Personal Clock is first advanced to 10, then to 1, and finally settles at Tick 2. Players can use the Personal Clocks at the bottom of the Model sheets with paper clips to track Ticks for each Model. Alternatively, write names on blank counters and slide them back and forth on the Round Clock to track Ticks for all Models in one place. 3.3 Terrain Types Before the game starts, the players should agree on what Type to assign to each piece of Terrain on the board. Each piece of Terrain might have multiple Types: Open Terrain: Flat areas of ground or pieces of Terrain with no effect. Difficult Terrain: Rough and stoney ground, shallow water, slick ice. Models move at half speed (e.g., 1” is treated as 2”). Dangerous Terrain: Craggy rocks, vine-covered jungles, all count as Dangerous Terrain. All Dangerous Terrain is treated as Difficult Terrain. In addition, the first time a Model enters Dangerous Terrain it must pass an Athletics Check or take the Knocked Down Condition. Impassable Terrain: High walls, chasms, or lava pits are included. A Model can never enter Impassable Terrain (though they might leap it!) Obscuring Terrain: Fog, thick bush, etc., that provides Cover but does not block LOS. Blocking Terrain: Opaque or solid materials that block LOS. Adversaries are immune to the effects of Difficult and Dangerous Terrain. Borders &amp; Exits Prior to the game, the players should decide which parts of the Play Area’s edges (Borders) are considered Exits. Exits allow Cazadores and Companions to flee from the fight and be removed from the Play Area alive. The rest of the Borders are considered Impassable Terrain that cannot be overcome. Players should consider the location of the Hunt when determining which parts of Borders are Exits. For example, on an open field it’s entirely possible that all Borders are Exits, whereas in a cave, there is likely only one way out. Cover If any potential line for determining LOS passes through Obscuring Terrain, the defender benefits from Cover. Cover grants Disadvantage to the Model making a Melee or Shooting Attack. Areas Areas refer to circular templates that are placed on the Play Area. Each Area always has a number associated with it that indicates the diameter of the template (e.g., Area 3, indicates a 3” template). 3.4 Cazadores &amp; Companions The players’ Models are either Cazadores, the fearless and exceptional hunters who lead the Pack against insurmountable odds, or Companions, specialists, helpers, familiars, and reticent civilians who aid them on their travails. Attributes Attributes are a Model’s raw capabilities and aptitudes. They represent strengths and weaknesses that are relevant during the Hunt. Speed (SPD): The Model’s quickness during the Hunt, indicating how far they can move in inches in one Action. Prowess (PROW): The Model’s physical strength, agility, and fitness, affecting their Athletics and Melee Skills. Sharpness (SHRP): The keenness of a Model’s senses and dexterity, affecting their Shooting and Stealth Skills. Wits (WIT): The Model’s awareness, understanding, and intuition, affecting their Hunt and Lore Skills. Resolve (RES): Stamina, bravery, and other intangibles that keep a Model in the fight, affecting their Fortitude and Leadership Skills. Skills Skills represent a Model’s expertise derived from training or experience in a specific area of the Hunt. Skills are always a combination of aptitude and expertise so each is paired with an Attribute (e.g., Melee [PROW]). Prowess (PROW) Skills: Athletics: Honed physical endurance and coordination. Melee: Skill in close combat. Sharpness (SHRP) Skills: Shooting : Skill in ranged combat. Stealth: Expertise at hiding and ambushing. Wits (WIT) Skills: Hunt: Expertise in tracking and other aspects of the Hunt. Lore: Knowledge of Foes, Rituals, and other dark secrets. Resolve (RES) Skills: Fortitude: Grit and steadfastness. Leadership: Inspirational qualities and knowledge of tactics. A Particular Set of Skills When making Checks, Cazadores roll d10s equal to the sum of the paired Skill and Attribute Ratings but Companions and Foes rely only on their Attributes. Wounds A Model’s capacity to endure agony and stay in the fight are measured in terms of their Wounds (WNDs). Should a Model’s Wounds be reduced to 0, that model is dead or irrevocably lost to the horrors of the Hunt. Defences &amp; Armour Models also have Defence (DEF) Ratings that indicate how well they are able to avoid or protect themselves from damage. In practice, these Ratings serve as the DT other Models must overcome when Attacking them. For the players’ Models, these Ratings are calculated as follows: Melee Defence (MDEF): The sum of PROW and Armour. Shooting Defence (SDEF): The sum of SHRP and Armour. Most Models are also equipped with some degree of protection that is referred to as Armour. In general, the greater the protection provided by the Armour, the greater a hindrance it is to a Model, giving a penalty to their SPD Rating. 3.5 Foes The Foes opposing the Cazadores are defined with less detail but with all the Attributes required to be worthy opponents. They are either Minions or Adversaies. Foes’ Actions are determined using Foe Type, Decision Trees, and the Adversary Deck. Attributes All Foes are defined by a condensed list of Attributes: Speed (SPD): Quickness and how far it can move in one Action in inches. Attack (ATK): Ferocity in close (Melee) and ranged (Shooting) combat. Range (RNG): Reach in close combat, often modified if the Model has access to Shooting Attacks. Terror (TER): Unnatural power, used to terrify and clear Conditions. Defence (DEF): Physical agility and strength, defining its capacity to defend itself against Attacks, traps, etc. Wounds (WND): Physical health. Foe Types Minions are the minor Foes that aid the Adversary in attempting to crush the Cazadores. They follow a simple set of Decision Trees to execute Actions during their Turns that varies according to their Foe Type: Aggressive (♠): Models that seek to engage the Cazadores, heedless of the danger and odds. Usually focused on close combat. Defensive (♦): Models that avoid close combat maintaining range or seeking strength in numbers. Usually focused on ranged combat. Sentry (♣): Models that do not focus on engaging the Cazadores in combat and instead patrol Objectives or positions near the Adversary. Foe Move and Recover Actions Like other Models, Foes also receive a free Move Action, therefore, the first Move Action is often free. However, Foes can take the Recover Action instead of the free Move Action, and will always do so to clear Conditions before resolving Decision Trees. Foes will also always move as far as possible as whenever they execute a Move Action. Determining Aggro Whenever there are multiple possible Targets for a Foe’s actions, the players determine Aggro, according to Foe Type, in order to select a final Target. Ties for Aggro are broken randomly by rolling a d10. Aggressive (♠) : Hostile Model within 10”, LOS, and most WNDs remaining. Defensive (♦): Hostile Model within 10”, LOS, and least WNDs remaining. Sentry (♣): Closest Hostile Model within 10” and LOS. Decision Trees A Minion’s Turn involves answering “Yes or No” questions, in order, according to their Decision Tree and executing the first “Yes” response. Table 3.1: Foe Decision Trees Foe Type Question Order Aggressive (♠) 1) Close Combat; 2) Aggress; 3) Reposition; 4) Hold Ground Defensive (♦) 1) Retreat; 2) Reposition; 3) Aggress; 4) Hold Ground Sentry (♣) 1) Close Combat; 2) Ranged Combat; 3) Reposition; 4) Hold Ground Decision Tree Questions Aggress: Is the Foe within 10” of a Hostile Model? Yes: Foe takes Move Action toward Target, then Close Combat, else Ranged Combat, else take a second Move Action toward Target. Close Combat: Is the Foe within LOS and Melee Attack range of a Hostile Model? Yes: The Foe takes a Melee Attack Action against the Target. End Turn. Hold Ground: The Foe holds their position and takes the Pass Action. Ranged Combat: Is the Foe within LOS and Shooting Attack range of a Hostile Model? Yes: The Foe takes a Shooting Attack Action against the Target. End Turn. Reposition: Is the Foe more than 5” away from Friendly Models or Objectives? Yes: The Foe takes a Move Action toward whichever is closest in this order: 1) furthest Objective, 2) largest group of Minions, 3) the Adversary; then Close Combat, else Ranged Combat, else Hold Ground. Retreat: Is the Foe within a Hostile Model’s LOS and Melee Attack range? Yes: The Foe takes a Move Action away from the Target and any other Hostile Models, then Ranged Combat, else Hold Ground. Resolving “Else” in Decision Trees Some decisions require a Foe check other questions, as indicated by “else”. This means that the Foe executes the next question in the order that is a “Yes”. For example, after the first move in Aggress, the Foe checks Close Combat, then Ranged Combat, with a second Move as the last choice to no other Yes responses. Adversaries and The Adversary Deck Adversaries are the major Foes of any Hunt and, in turn, they are much more unpredictable and dangerous. To the simulate the greater danger posed by these Foes, each Adversary uses the Adversary Deck, a standard 52-card deck of playing cards split and shuffled to form two separate piles, Hit Locations (the numbered 2-10 cards) and Actions (the Ace and face cards). Each Adversary has a detailed entry for their Adversary Deck that describes specific Hit Locations and Actions tailored to fit their nature and particular qualities, these can be found in The Adversary book but you can find one in the Quickstart chapter. Hit Locations All Adversaries have their total number of Wounds (WNDs) spread out across various Hit Locations. Whenever the players’ Models successfully attack the Adversary, they flip a number of Hit Location cards equal to WNDs dealt, and the WNDs are removed from that specific Hit Location. When a specific Hit Location’s Wounds have been exhausted (i.e., are reduced to 0), there is usually an ongoing effect that comes into play. These effects are described in the Adversary’s entry. In addition, all future WNDs dealt to that Hit Location are treated as WNDs to the next highest Hit Location. An Adversary’s Upper Limbs take 3 WNDs with 1 left. The last WND is removed and the remaining 2 WNDs are dealt to its next highest Hit Location, in this case, the Torso. Adversary Actions During the Adversary’s Turn, the players flip over and reveal one card from the Adversary’s deck of Actions. The specific card revealed is interpreted in terms of its suit and value to determine the Adversary’s Actions for its Turn. The suit determines which Foe Type the Adversary will use this Turn: Spades (♠): Aggressive Foe Type Diamonds (♦) : Defensive Foe Type Clubs (♣): Sentry Foe Type Hearts (♥): Special Foe Type The Special Foe Type is only applicable to Adversaries and refers to a mixed set of Foe Types that the Adversary will follow as detailed in their entry. For example, a Jack of Hearts might refer to the Defensive Decision Tree whereas the Queen of Hearts might refer to the Aggressive Decision Tree. The value on the card determines the specific Action that the Adversary will take. Usually this is a form of Attack and includes additional specialized modifiers tailored to the Adversary. An example Adversary Action Ace (Sweeping Smash): +2 ATK +1 RNG. All Hostile Models within RNG suffer a Melee Attack. Models hit are pushed 2” away. Exhausting the Adversary Deck When the Hit Location or Action decks for the Adversary are exhausted, the players should simply take the discard piles, and without shuffling, turn them over to create new Hit Location and Action piles. This allows the players to predict the Adversary’s Actions to some degree. "],["4-playing.html", "4 Playing The Game 4.1 Game Setup 4.2 Game Structure 4.3 Actions", " 4 Playing The Game 4.1 Game Setup 1. Choose an Adversary Each game encompasses a Hunt for a dangerous and terrifying Foe, the Adversary, so the first step of setting up for a game is for the players to select an Adversary as the target of the Hunt. Players can choose from the Adversaries in The Adversary or develop one of their own based on the guidelines provided there. In campaign play, the Adversary for a Hunt might be determined by events in a previous game or the evolving story between play sessions. Take the time to prepare the Model for it and any Minions to the best of your ability. While the Cazadores are the protagonists, the Adversary is the centrepiece and they should serve as a ferocious and intimidating enemy. The entries for the Adversaries provide broad descriptions of these terrors but they are meant to be a source of inspiration, not strict representations. Use any Model you see fit to represent the Adversary and any other Model in the game. Interpreting the entries is part of the fun! 2. Rally The Pack A Pack is always composed of 2-4 Models with one Cazador per player. The rest of the Models in a Pack are composed of Companions. See the table for Player Models in Game to determine how many Companions each player is allowed during the Hunt. Table 4.1: Player Models in A Hunt Players Cazadores Companions 1 1 1-3 2 1 per player 1 per player 3 1 per player None 4 1 per player None 4.1.1 3. Arrange The Play Area {-} Set up a Play Area that is approximately 24” x 24” and place appropriate Terrain for the encounter with the Adversary. If you are using the Scouting &amp; Preparation phase as described in the Narrative Rules chapter, it might provide some guidance as to what Terrain is appropriate. Have the Cazadores tracked the Adversary to its lair? Has the Adversary attacked the city and is currently rampaging through its streets? Any of these scenarios is feasible and ripe for ideas to use in designing the Play Area. Once all the Terrain has been placed, the players should take the time to discuss which pieces of Terrain are considered to be of each Terrain Type, and which sections of the Borders are considered Exits, to reduce confusion during play. 4. Set Up Objectives Cazadores is most rewarding as a game when the players are also attempting to achieve additional Objectives beyond defeating the Adversary. For your first game, you might play without Objectives but after that we recommend you use the Objectives rules. If you’re playing with Objectives, at this stage you should follow special setup rules outlined there. Note that these might impact other parts of Game Setup. 5. Deploy Models Deploying Foes To deploy Foes, make a Scatter Roll from the centre of the Play Area and place the Adversary at that position. For the Minions, make a Scatter Roll from the position of the Adversary to place each at their final positions. When deploying Minions, do your best to place them at least 3” away from all other Minions. You can apply these guidelines with an eye for narrative. To do this, try to place Aggressive Minions so that they form front lines, Defensive Minions behind them, and Sentry Minions orbiting the Objective or the Adversary. Deploying The Pack The players then take turns deploying their Cazadores and Companions. Each of these Models must be deployed within 3” of one of the Exits on the Play Area unless the Objective or narrative requires otherwise. 6. Mark The Clocks Mark the Round Clock to Tick 1 and do the same for the Models’ Personal Clocks. It’s possible that Scouting or Preparation might impact it so that some Models start at later Ticks, adjust accordingly. 7. Embark On The Hunt After the previous steps are completed, the Hunt begins and the game is played over a series of Rounds divided into Ticks. On each Tick all eligible Models take Turns to act before advancing the Round Clock to the next Tick. Models are considered “eligible” to take a Turn when their Personal Clocks match the Round Clock. That is, both Clocks are on the same Tick. 4.2 Game Structure Each game takes place over a series of Rounds, where each Round is made up of 10 Ticks. Ticks are loose units of time that dictate when Models can act and take a Turn. Executing Rounds 1. Determine Eligible Models At the beginning of each Round, compare the Tick on the Round Clock to all Models’ Personal Clocks. Any Models whose Personal Clocks match the Round Clock are eligible and can take a Turn on this Tick. 2. Break Clock Ties If multiple Models are eligible to act on this Tick, then you must Break Clock Ties. To do so, the Cazador with the greatest Resolve Rating that is eligible on this Tick makes a Leadership Check with a DT equal to the highest Terror Rating of all Foes eligible on this Tick. If the Check is successful, that Cazador’s player elects whether the Pack or the Foes resolve their Turns first. On a failure, or if no Cazador is eligible on this Tick, then Foes execute their Turns first. When the players’ Models are the only eligible Models , the players choose the order in which Turns are carried out. When only the Foes are eligible on a Tick, the Adversary acts first, then the remaining Minions activate in a random order. 3. Carry Out Turns Each eligible Model resolves their Turn completely before the next eligible Model resolves their Turn. See Executing Turns. 4. Advance Round Clock Once all eligible Models have carried out their Turns, advance the Round Clock forward by 1 Tick, then return to step 1 in Executing Rounds. However, if the Round Clock would advance beyond Tick 10, instead proceed to Ending the Round. 5. Ending The Round If the Round Clock would advance beyond Tick 10, instead it is reset to Tick 1 and the Round ends. When the Round ends, check for and resolve any effects that take place at the end of the Round. Conditions and Objectives are the most common sources of effects that are resolved at the end of the Round. After resolving the end of the Round, check whether the Hunt ends according to Ending the Hunt. 6. Ending The Hunt The game is over at the end of the Round when one of the following is true: Slaughter: Either all Pack Models or all Foes are unable to continue because their WNDs have been exhausted. The Pack Flees: All remaining Pack Models have fled the Play Area. Objectives: A special condition dictated by an Objective that ends the Hunt is fulfilled. During campaigns, the outcome of the Hunt grants Renown based on the degree of success (or failure). To determine the Renown gained (or lost), see The Eternal Hunt. Executing Turns 1. Declare First Action All Models can take one free Move Action and one more Action on their Turn in any order they choose. The Model declares their First Action and advances their Personal Clock by that Action’s Tick Cost unless it is their free Move Action for the Turn. For Foes, when resolving a Decision Tree that would require the Foe to move, they always use their free Move Action first, reserving their second Action for their Attack, unless that Action must also be ultimately spent for movement. 2. Execute First Action After paying the Tick Cost for their First Action, the Model attempts any Checks required for their Action and any results from success or failure take effect. The first Action must be resolved completely before the second Action is declared. 3. Declare Second Action The Model declares their second Action and advances their Personal Clock by its Tick Cost. 4. Execute Second Action The Model attempts any Checks required for their second Action and results of success or failure take place. The Model then proceeds to Ending the Turn. 5. Ending The Turn After executing their second Action, the Model ends their Turn and any effects that occur at the end of that Model’s Turn are resolved. Clarifications Action Types The different Actions available to each Model are categorized under three Types: Movement Actions, Combat Actions, and Special Actions. Throughout the game, these Types are used to refer to all Actions under each Type. For example, conditions or other effects might place a Model at Disadvantage to perform all actions of a specific Type. Free Move Action During its Turn, every Model receives a free Move Action, such that they can execute it without paying for its Tick Cost. If a Model chooses not to use its Move Action, treat it as if it executed a Move Action choosing to move 0”. Foes can exchange their free Move Action for the Recover Action but the players’ Models cannot. See Foe Move and Recover Actions. Cost of The Pass Actions If a Model foregoes taking an Action during their Turn, they are treated as executing the Pass Action and advance their Personal Clock by 1 Tick. Note that choosing not to use the free Move Action does not count as taking a Pass Action. Instead, it is treated as taking the free Move Action but choosing to move 0”. 4.3 Actions 4.3.1 Movement Actions Cover Ground (3 Ticks) The Model attempting the Action makes an Athletics Check. If successful, the Model can move up to its Speed (SPD) plus 1” for each Success rolled. On a failure, the Model cannot move. Remember that Models pay an Action’s Tick cost prior to attempting the relevant Check and regardless of its outcome. Move (2 Ticks) The Model taking this Action can move up to its Speed. 4.3.2 Situational Movement Jumping and Leaving Models can “leap” over any Terrain less than or equal to 1” tall as if it was 0” tall. Models can also “jump” over any chasms or the like if their movement will allow them to “land” on the other side. Climbing and Falling For Terrain that is over 1” tall, Models can “climb” by spending movement to move vertically up Terrain. When climbing, a Model must end its Turn on a part of the Terrain that allows them to hold the position until their next Turn. This might vary across Hunts. A cliff face might be treated differently during a storm than clear weather. A Model struck by an Attack, or that ends their Turn on unstable Terrain might suffer damage. To do so, make a Melee Attack against them treating the fall in inches as the Attack’s Rating. 4.3.3 Combat Actions Attack (3 Ticks) The Model attempting the Action makes a Melee or Shooting Check with Difficulty Threshold (DT) equal to their Target’s relevant Defence. The Skill and relevant Defence used for the Check is determined by the Weapon. Additionally, the Weapon used in the Action must be Readied and the Target must be within the Weapon’s Range and within Line of Sight (LOS). If successful, the Model deals Wounds (WNDs) equal to the Successes rolled plus the Weapon’s Power (POW). Cast Ritual (4 Ticks) The Model attempting the Action makes a Lore Check with DT 7. Other requirements as outlined within the Ritual’s description must be fulfilled to make the attempt. For example, the Target must be within the Ritual’s Range. If successful, the effects of the Ritual are applied. Defend (2 Ticks) The Model enters a defensive stance. All Models make Attack Actions at Disadvantage against this Model until the start of its next Turn. Focus (2 Ticks) The Model prepares for their next Attack. This Model can choose to gain Advantage to its next Attack Action or add or subtract up to 2 from the Hit Location of all WNDs dealt by their next Attack. With the exception of free Move Actions, The Advantage gained by this Action expires if the next Action taken by this Model is not an Attack. Hide (3 Ticks) To attempt this Action, the Model must be within 1” of Obscuring or Blocking Terrain. The Model attempting the Action makes a Stealth Check using the highest Attack (ATK) Rating of all Hostile Models within 3”. If successful, the Model gains the Hidden Condition. Parry (4 Ticks) The Model selects a single Target and makes Melee Check with a DT equal to the Target’s ATK. If successful, the next successful Melee Attack by the Target on this Model is cancelled and this Model immediately makes an Attack with Advantage against the Target. This Action expires at the start of this Model’s next Turn. Reload (1 Tick) The Model reloads 1 Ammo into a Shooting Weapon. Spot Weakness (4 Ticks) To attempt this Action, the Model selects a single Target within 5”. The Model attempting the Action makes a Hunt Check with DT equal to the Target’s Defence Rating. If successful, this Model and Friendly Models gain Advantage on Attacks against the Target for the rest of the Round. Switch (1 Tick) The Model switches which Weapons or Gear are considered Readied, following any relevant restrictions. See Readied Weapons in Detail in the Combat chapter. 4.3.4 Special Actions Aid (2 Ticks) The Model attempting the Action makes a Leadership Check with DT 5. If successful, a Friendly Model within 3” immediately succeeds at a Recover Action. Flee (3 Ticks) If the Model is within 1” of an Exit, the Model attempting the Action makes an Athletics Check with DT 7. If successful, the Model leaves the Play Area, escaping the Hunt with their life. Pass (2 Ticks) The Model is idle, biding their time. Recover (2 Ticks) The Model attempting the Action makes a Fortitude Check with DT 5. If successful, the Model clears one Condition of their choice. Foes use their Terror Rating instead of Fortitude to make the Check. If a Foe is affected by multiple Conditions, randomly determine which Condition is cleared by rolling a die. Use Gear (3 Ticks) Model attempts to use a piece of Gear, so long as they meet other requirements for its usage. For example, a Gear that indicates “Must Ready” must be considered Readied prior to attempting this Action. The Skill and DT used in the Check is determined by the Gear’s description. If successful, apply the effects of the Gear and, for Gear with limited Ammo, reduce Ammo by 1. On a failure, the effects do not occur but Ammo is still reduced by 1. Table 4.2: Actions Summary Name Ticks Effect Movement Actions Cover Ground 3 Athletics Check. If successful, move up to SPD + 1” per Success. Move 2 Model moves up to its SPD. Combat Actions Attack 3 Melee or Shooting Check (DT Target DEF) with a Readied Weapon. Success deals Wounds equal to Successes plus Weapon POW. Cast Ritual 4 Lore Check (DT 7). If successful, apply the selected Ritual’s effects. Defend 2 Models Attack this Model at Disadvantage until this Model’s next Turn. Focus 2 Model gains Advantage to next Attack or add/subtract up to 2 from Hit Location of next Attack. Hide 3 Model must be within 1” of Obscuring or Blocking Terrain. Stealth Check (DT highest Hostile Model ATK within 3”). If successful, gain the Hidden Condition. Parry 4 Melee Check (DT Target ATK). Next successful Melee Attack by Target on this Model is cancelled and Model Attacks Target with Advantage. Reload 1 Model reloads 1 Ammo into a Shooting Weapon. Spot Weakness 4 Hunt Check (DT Target DEF within 5”). This Model and Friendly Models gain Advantage on Attacks against Target for rest of Round. Switch 1 Model switches which Weapons or Gear are considered Readied. Special Actions Aid 2 Leadership Check (DT 5). 1 Model within 3” succeeds at a Recover Action. Flee 3 Athletics Check (DT 7; within 1” of Exit). Model leaves the Play Area. Pass 1 The Model is idle. Recover 2 Fortitude Check (DT 5). Model clears one Condition. Foes use Terror instead of Fortitude to make Check. Use Gear 3 Model makes use of Gear and applies effects on Success. Skill used in the Check is determined by Gear. "],["5-combat.html", "5 Combat 5.1 Attacking 5.2 Weapons 5.3 Other Combat Rules 5.4 Conditions", " 5 Combat The majority of the Hunt is embroiled in frenzied combat and Models are liable to make and suffer Attacks that force them to take Wounds (WND) and incur Conditions. 5.1 Attacking A Model attacks by taking the Attack Action against a Hostile Model within Range (RNG) and Line of Sight (LOS) with one of their Readied Weapons. The Attack Action is executed by making a Melee or Shooting Check using the Target’s relevant Defence (DEF) as the Difficulty Threshold (DT). For each Success, the Target loses 1 WND. Criticals &amp; Abilities Some Cazadores, Foes, and Weapons have Abilities that award a passive benefit or that can be activated when the Model rolls a Critical (a natural 10) on a relevant check (e.g., Attacks for Weapons). Abilities that require a Critical to be activated are preceded by Crit (e.g., Crit: Impose the Poisoned Condition). Abilities can only be activated once during the Model’s Turn, so Criticals remaining after activating Abilities are treated as normal Successes. 5.2 Weapons Cazadores and Companions can carry up to 3 Weapons into a Hunt but only Readied Weapons are eligible for use in Attacks. Whenever the players’ Models make an Attack, they must do so with a Readied Weapon and the Target must be within RNG of that Weapon. On a successful Attack, the Model also deals additional WNDs equal to their Weapon’s Power (POW), however, most Weapons have a POW of 0. Especially large or cumbersome Weapons might have also add Ticks to Attacks. For example, if a Cazador makes a Melee Check with their Ancestral Sword (POW 2) and rolls 3 Successes, they would deal 5 WNDs. Readied Weapons in Detail Although Models can bring up to 3 Weapons into a Hunt, only one Weapon per hand can be Readied. All Cazadores and Companions have two hands, therefore, they can have two 1-handed Weapons (e.g., two swords, or a spear and shield) or one 2-handed Weapon (e.g., a battleaxe or a bow) at the Ready. Models can take the Switch Action to swap any Weapon or Gear with their Readied Weapons. Additionally, only Weapons that are Readied provide their Abilities to a Model. For example, if a Model with a Readied shield were to switch it for another Weapon, they would lose the +1 Armour benefit granted by the shield. Special Gear as Weapons In practice, some Special Gear act as Weapons, such that they must be Readied and are used during Attacks (e.g., Fire Bombs). Any Gear that functions in this manner will indicate that it must be Readied prior to use and, therefore, can be part of a Switch Action. However, Special Gear are not considered Weapons for the purposes of a Model’s 3 Weapon limit. Dual Wielding Models with two 1-handed Weapons Readied can choose which Weapon they will use prior to making an Attack, so long as the Target is within RNG of both Weapons. In practice, “dual wielding” is most useful when the Model has two Weapons with distinct Abilities that are advantageous in different situations. Ammo Exclusively ranged Weapons like bows, crossbows, and pistols all start the Hunt with 3 Ammo. Each time the Weapon is fired, its Ammo is reduced by 1. The Weapon cannot be fired again once its Ammo reaches 0. Some Special Gear functions similarly and are also limited by Ammo, though they might have more or less Ammo than the standard 3. Once a Shooting Weapon is fired, the Model must take the Reload Action to use it again on a future Turn; this does not apply to Special Gear. At the end of the Hunt, the Ammo for Shooting Weapons or Special Gear are automatically restored. Unarmed Combat If a Model finds itself without an eligible Weapon (for example, having run out of Ammo on their Weapons), they can engage other Models in unarmed combat. Unarmed is considered a Weapon with RNG 0” and POW 0. Foes and Weapons Foes do not require Weapons to make Attacks. All of their innate and equipped capabilities for destruction are summarized in their ATK and RNG Attributes. Therefore, Foes do not concern themselves with Ammo, reloading, switching weapons, or any other of these associated rules. However, remember that a Foe’s RNG indicates their reach in close combat. If they are capable of Shooting Attacks, their entry will note when this is modified with additional RNG. 5.3 Other Combat Rules Surrounded Whenever a Model is within close combat range of more Hostile Models than Friendly Models they are Surrounded. Attackers gain Advantage to Attack Actions against Surrounded Models. The Adversary is never Surrounded. No “Engaged” Rule Many games contain a rule that refers to “engagement” or a similar term that indicates that Models within range of close combat with each other cannot move away without succeeding at a disengagement action or suffering opportunity strikes from their opponent. There is no such rule in this game. Cazadores are expert fighters and hunters who can weave their way through the battlefield in the face of lethal strikes from Foes. Therefore, locking Cazadores into a position is mostly reserved for effects inflicted by specially dangerous Foes. Most close combat Weapons have a RNG of 1” to support this approach. Terror Attacks While Cazadores must rely on cutting down their enemies, Foes can also use their innate fearsomeness to make Attacks using their Terror Rating. These Attacks are usually reserved for the Adversary. Terror Attacks often affect multiple models and impose the Terrified Condition, but rarely inflict Wounds (WNDs). Terror Attacks are considered Shooting Attacks with the following exceptions: The Foe uses their Terror Rating to make the Shooting Check. The DT for the Attack is the Target’s Fortitude Rating. 5.4 Conditions During the course of the fight, Models are likely to be afflicted by a variety of Conditions that impact their effectiveness. During the game, players can use the tokens provided in Model Sheets and Counters or set a d10 matching the Condition’s number next to the affected Model. Table 5.1: Conditions Condition Effect 1. Bleeding Model takes 1 WND after completing the Move or Cover Ground Action. 2. Burning Model takes 4 WNDs at end of Round. 3. Defenceless There is no DT to Attack this Model. 4. Freezing SPD -2. Model makes Stealth &amp; Athletics Checks at Disadvantage. 5. Hidden Model is not eligible to be considered a Target in Foes’ Decision Trees though it may still suffer Attacks or effects that target an Area or all Hostile Models. Model gains Advantage if the next Attack is made with this Condition. Any Action other than Move cancels the Condition. Condition expires at the end of the Round. 6. Knocked Down Model can only take the Recover Action and has the Defenceless Condition until Knocked Down is removed. 7. Poisoned Model takes 1 WND at end of Round. Model has Disadvantage on Fortitude Checks. 8. Stunned Model can only take the Move or Recover Actions. 9. Terrified Model must immediately move up to their SPD away from the Foe that Terrified it. Model cannot move toward that Foe until this Condition is cleared. "],["6-pack.html", "6 Gathering The Pack 6.1 Renown &amp; Enlistment 6.2 Cazadores 6.3 Companion Types", " 6 Gathering The Pack When Cazadores come together with their allies and others of their kind for a Hunt, they form a Pack. When Gathering the Pack, players choose from their Cazador’s Enlisted Companions. When there are multiple Cazadores on a Hunt, each can only choose from their own Enlisted Companions and must choose up to the maximum allowed according to the number of players in the game, see Game Setup. 6.1 Renown &amp; Enlistment Cazadores are the subjects of legend. Ferocious and unyielding in the face of dire Foes, their deeds earn them Renown. Cazadores trade on their deeds, using it to requisition the resources they require for the next Hunt. Renown also allows Cazadores to draw the zealous, naive, and unwilling into their service, paying their Companions’ Enlistment cost in Renown. Each Cazador can have up to 5 Companions Enlisted and ready to aid on a Hunt. However, just as glory can be earned in the Hunt, it can also be lost, and Cazadores can find themselves stretched for supplies and with their staunchest allies deserting the cause. For more, see The Eternal Hunt. 6.2 Cazadores All Cazadores start the game with a standard array for their Attribute Ratings as outlined below, 0 in every Skill Rating, no Rituals, 1 Weapon of their choice, and Light Armour. Each player can then spend 10 Renown to increase their Attributes or Skills, obtain Weapons, Armour, or Special Gear, and recruit Companions. Renown must also be spent according to the restrictions below when creating a Cazador, and never exceed the maximum due to Advancement. Improving Attributes, SPD, WNDs, and Skills costs 1 Renown per increment during creation.

Their bodies are honed instruments of the Hunt, but they must still rely on an assortment of Weapons, Armour, and Special Gear to overcome their Foes. Cazadores rely on these tools of the Hunt to such a degree that they trade and stake their reputations and Renown to ensure the Pack is properly equipped. Each Cazador or Companion, may be equipped with up to 3 Weapons, 1 Armour, and 2 Special Gear.

The most abhorrent and compelling of these are Rituals. These dark incantations, inscriptions, and songs allow the most dogged of Cazadores to bend the natural order to their will and wield it against their Foes. In campaigns, Cazadores can also burden their most steadfast companions with the contrivances of these despicable hymns. The frailty of the human will means Cazadores and Companions can only bear knowledge of 3 Rituals and must forego all memory of an existing Ritual to learn the inner workings of another. Similarly, successfully casting a Ritual also temporarily corrupts the portion of the mind on which it is inscribed, limiting each Ritual to a single successful casting per Hunt. Unless noted otherwise: Ongoing effects expire at the end of the Hunt. Rituals that affect all models include the casting Model. When the effects of a Ritual require a roll, roll once and apply the value to all Models affected. Fiendish tools make no distinctions ’tween earthly flesh.

Each Objective details any changes to the Game Setup and special rules that only apply when playing with that Objective, and how Renown is earned or lost due to the Objective. There are 10 Objectives and these have been numbered so they can be randomly introduced into a Hunt by rolling a d10 prior to play. Any setup required for an Objective should always be done before deploying Models, including Foes. The Renown rules for each Objective are always used in The Eternal Hunt, but can also be used on their own to help link together multiple games by introducing consequences for the Pack’s successes and failures. Renown earned or lost is always calculated at the end of the Hunt. Renown and the Adversary When using the Renown rules for Objectives, Renown is also always earned based on the degree of damage done to the Adversary: Gain 1d5 Renown for each of the Adversary’s Hit Locations that have been exhausted (reduced to 0 WNDs). If the Adversary is defeated (all Hit Locations reduced to 0 WNDs), gain an additional 1d5 Renown. 1. Assassinate the Vessel Objective: Kill the human Vessel Model linked to the Adversary. To do so, the Pack must reduce the Vessel’s WNDs to 0. Game Setup: Deploy the Vessel at the centre of the table, then deploy all Foes using Scatter Rolls from the Vessel. Special Rules Vessel Area 1-sized Model. This model is considered a Hostile Model to the Pack. The Vessel has the following Attributes: Vessel Attributes SPD ATK RNG DEF TER WND - - - 6 5 10 Passive: This Model cannot execute any Actions.

Banish The Well Objective: Pack Model must succeed at a Cast Ritual Action (DT 5) within 1” of the Cosmic Well and while no Hostile Models are within 1” of the Cosmic Well. Game Setup: Place a Cosmic Well (Area 2) from the centre of the Play Area with a Scatter Roll.

Special Rules Net: Net Weapon as described in Gear. 1 Pack Model can temporarily take the Net into the Hunt at no cost, exchanging it for one of their Weapons if necessary to remain within the 3 Weapon limit. After the Hunt, the Net is removed from the Model’s Gear and, if needed, the exchanged Weapon is returned. Additional Nets can be purchased and are treated as normal. Capturing the Adversary When a Pack Model succeeds at an Attack Action with the Net against the Adversary, resolve the Attack as normal. Then, at the end of the Round upon which this Attack succeeded, immediately make a Subdue Check (DT 5) using the number of the Adversary’s Hit Locations exhausted as the Rating (e.g., 3 Hit Locations reduced to 0 WNDs = 3d10s against DT 5). If successful, the Adversary is captured and considered defeated. If failed, the Adversary breaks from the Net and another Attack Action with the Net must succeed to trigger this roll again on a future Round. If the Adversary is defeated (all Hit Locations exhausted ) before the Capturing the Adversary roll succeeds, then the Objective cannot be accomplished. The Pack gains Renown as normal for the Adversary’s Hit Locations that are exhausted when it is captured, although they cannot gain the Renown for defeating the Adversary in the traditional manner (i.e., exhausting all WNDs). Renown Gain 1d10 + 5 for successfully capturing the Adversary. Lose 1d5 for failing to capture the Adversary. 4. Escape the Ambush Objective: Flee from the Play Area with as many Pack Models as possible. Game Setup: Deploy all Pack Models with Scatter Rolls from the centre of the Play Area. Next, deploy The Adversary using a Scatter Roll from a random Pack Model. Deploy all Foes in this manner, each time using a different Pack Model as the starting point for the Scatter Roll. Special Rules None. Renown Gain 1d5 + 1 Renown for each Pack Model that successfully Flees. Lose 1d5 Renown for each Pack Model that does not Flee. 5. Exterminate Foes Objective: The Pack must defeat all Foes during the Hunt. Game Setup: None required. Special Rules If a Minion can be continuously “respawned” by the Adversary, the Pack only needs to defeat three Minions to consider the Minion defeated for the purposes of the objective. Renown Gain 1d10 + 5 Renown for defeating all Foes. Lose 1d5 Renown for each Foe that is not defeated. 6. Forge The Seal Objective: Pack Models must apply Warding Talc to three Warding Points by succeeding at a Cast Ritual Action (DT 5) while within 1” of a Warding Point. Game Setup: Place three Warding Points (Area 1) from the centre of the Play Area using a Scatter Roll but using a d10 instead of a d5 to determine distance of the scatter. All Warding Points should be placed at least 3” away from each other. Special Rules Warding Points: Area 1. A cosmically-aligned space imbued with power. Warding Talc can be applied to a Warding Point by a Pack Model within 1” that is carrying Warding Talc by succeeding at a Cast Ritual Action (DT 5). Warding Talc (Lore Check, DT 5): Warding Talc does not count as Gear, therefore Models cannot exceed their Max Gear allotment due to carrying Warding Talc. Warding Talc is considered to have unlimited Ammo. 3 Pack Models can start with Warding Talc in their Gear at no cost. Additional doses of Warding Talc can be acquired for 1 Renown each. Renown Gain 1d10 Renown for applying Warding Talc to all Warding Points Gain 1d10 Renown if the Adversary is within the triangle created by the lines between Warding Points when the last point is warded. Lose 1d5 Renown for each Warding Point not successfully warded. 7. Raze Habitat Objective: Destroy the Adversary’s Territory Area by placing an Explosive Barrel. To do so, one Pack Model with the Explosive Barrel must succeed at a Use Gear Action while within the Area. At the end of the next Round after it is placed the Explosive Barrel detonates and the objective is accomplished. At least one Pack Model must be alive and in the Play Area when this occurs. Game Setup: Place an Area 3 counter representing the core of the Adversary’s territory with a Scatter Roll from the centre of the Play Area. Special Rules Explosive Barrel (Hunt Check, DT 5; must Ready): Area 1. 2-handed. Models within 5” suffer a Rating 5 Shooting Attack when it detonates. The Explosive Barrel does not count as Gear, therefore Models cannot exceed their Max Gear allotment due to carrying the Explosive Barrel. Each Model can carry 1 Explosive Barrel and it is considered to be Ammo 1. The Explosive Barrel is dropped within 1” of a Model reduced to 0 WNDs. Models can also choose to drop the Explosive Barrel at no cost but must succeed at a Hunt Check (DT 5) within 1” to pick it up. 3 Pack Models cans start the Hunt with 1 Explosive Barrel in their Gear. Additional Explosive Barrels can be acquired for 1 Renown each. Renown Gain 1d10 + 2 Renown for successfully destroying the Area.

Game Setup: Place three Artifacts (Area 1) from the centre of the Play Area with a Scatter Roll. Special Rules Artifact: Area 1. Artifacts do not count as Gear, therefore Models cannot exceed their Max Gear allotment due to carrying Artifacts. Each Model can carry up to 3 Artifacts. Recover an Artifact by succeeding at a Use Gear Action (Hunt Check) within 1” of the Artifact. Models reduced to 0 WNDs drop their Artifacts within 1” of the Model.

To do so, a Pack Model must find the Genuine Icon among the False Icons by succeeding at a Cast Ritual Action (DT 5) while within 1” of the Icon, then Flee the Play Area or survive until the end of the Hunt. Game Setup: Place three Icons from the centre of the Play Area using a Scatter Roll but using a d10 instead of a d5 to determine distance of scatter. All Icons should be placed at least 3” away from each other. Special Rules False &amp; Genuine Icons: Area 1. Icons do not count as Gear, therefore Models cannot exceed their Max Gear allotment due to carrying Icons. Each Model can carry up to 3 Icons. Models that reach 0 WNDs drop their Icons within 1” of the Model. Models can also choose to drop their Icons at no cost but must succeed at a Cast Ritual Action (DT 5) within 1” to pick them up. Finding the Genuine Icon: When a Pack Model succeeds at a Cast Ritual Action (DT 5) within 1” of an Icon, roll a 1d10 to discover if it is a Genuine or False Icon. On a 1-8, the Icon is False; On a 9-10, the Icon is Genuine. If the found Icon is the last remaining Icon on the Play Area to be discovered, it is automatically considered the Genuine Icon. Renown Gain 1d10 Renown for recovering the Genuine Icon. Gain 1 Renown for each False Icon recovered. Lose 1d5 Renown for failing to recover the Genuine Icon. 10.

"],["10-adversaryintro.html", "10 Book of the Adversary Using This Book Changelog", " 10 Book of the Adversary Here you’ll find what little is known about the abysmal and eternal foes of the Hunt. The Adversary is the quarry of a Hunt, though they are far from easy prey. They are powerful, cunning, and desperate to survive their encounter with a Cazador and their Pack. Adversaries are sometimes supported by a cadre of (Minions)[#foes] that fight and die to defend them, but the Adversary alone is the well from which the Hunt and its horrors abound. Each Adversary is unique, armed with knowledge and abilities that set it apart from other earthly creatures. However, all Adversaries are immune to the effects of Difficult and Dangerous Terrain and, despite a Pack’s numbers, they are never considered Surrounded. Using This Book In this book you’ll find everything that you need to set your Pack of Cazadores and Companions against the fearsome and unnatural creatures of the Hunt. In Foe Mechanics, you’ll find the most important rules that affect Foes, already contained in the book of The Hunter, reprinted here for easy reference. In Adversaries, you’ll find an account of all the Adversaries known to the keepers of the Hunt. In Adversary Sheets, you’ll also find a pre-filled Model Sheet for each Adversary in this book so that you can print or photocopy it for use at the table. Lastly, in Creating Adversaries, you’ll find some rough guidelines for you to tap into the whirling nightmares and horrors of the Hunt in your own mind. Changelog v.03 General The Adversary section is broken out into its own “book” for ease of use! New Adversaries: An Accursed Construct, A Creature Wreathed in Light, The Constant Emperor’s Praetorians, and A Neonate Wyrm. Wandering Son of the Mountain He’s received a few buffs to his stats (+1 ATK, +1 DEF, +TER), since he was a little too easy even as a starting Adversary. Some attacks have also received tweaks for clarity and balance. v.04 General Reduced the +RNG on all Adversary Action by 1 to make it a little easier to maneuver around them. Constant Emperor’s Praetorians -1 ATK and -1 SPD to the Praetorians who were a tad too strong. Special rules for The Triumvirate have been renamed under TThread That Binds so that The Triumvirate now explains how they are deployed. Additionally, clarified how much the Praetorian’s Personal Clock is advanced when they each take different actions while resolving decision trees. Creature Wreathed in Light -1 SPD to Attributes.

For this online version, simply go to that section in the Book of the Hunter. 1. An Accursed Construct Shifting and whispering plates of a sleek alloy. A mockery of a human face, unfocused, unwavering, and unfathomable. Clawed fusils cradle a floating core radiating with unnatural warmth. The orb burns without flame, compelling all living things to their end in seconds stretched over decades. The jealous and silent guardian to a place long withered and carried off by the earth, sea, and wind. Duty-bound, the knight patrols the borders of its master’s home. The rearguard to a war always on the horizon. Accursed Construct SPD ATK RNG DEF TER WND 4” 7 1\" 8 5 25 Special Rules Rapid Barrage (Special Suit): The Area 2 placed by this action is considered Difficult Terrain. Minions None.

The Constant Emperor’s Praetorians Bones thinly veiled by brackish skin, draped in darkness, the fiery words of their regent where their eyes once sat. The Praetorians, relentless and indomitable, sweep the long-forgotten trails once marched by their emperor’s army. Wielding the Cerulean Flame, they incinerate any and all things that have touched the ground upon which their emperor set foot on his final conquest. Heralds, confidants, and consorts to the emperor, from which all noble things flow, the Praetorians were ordered to safeguard the kingdom while he seized the last unknown corner of the map, never to return. Ageless, mad, and resentful, the Praetorians scour the earth. The Constant Emperor’s Praetorians SPD ATK RNG DEF TER WND 3” 4 1\" 5 5 30 Special Rules The Triumvirate: Deploy the praetorians by randomly determining which to deploy first with a Scatter Roll from the centre of the Play Area.

When all the Hit Locations for one Praetorian are exhausted, that Praetorian can no longer fight. The Sword, The Axe, and the Mace: The names of the Praetorians have long been lost to time so each is referred to by their chosen weapon. The Adversary’s Actions are executed by all of the Praetorians but the Target for each Praetorian’s Action is determined individually. The Praetorian with the most WNDs remaining always executes the Action first, otherwise order is determined at random. The Praetorian’s joint Personal Clock is advanced by the highest Tick Cost of all Actions performed. Minions None. Adversary Deck Hit Locations The Sword’s Flame (10): 5 WNDs.

A myriad of limbs moving with balletic grace. Greens, oranges, and golden filigree adorn the feathered wings that maintain it aloft in majesty. Vines flowering in a thousand radiant colors extend and brush terra firma.Deep under a canopy of ancient trees, heavy with dew, it waits for the end of days. From the edges of the rainforest travellers can feel the reverberations of the creature’s song. The nearer both flora and fauna are to the creature, the more rapturously they sway to its voice. Members of the joyful audience ocassionally plucked gently by a spear tip to sustain the creature’s vigil.

A Neonate Wurm A monstrous and writhing shape of muscle bound in a lustrous carapace. A thousand razored and hooked legs drag its mass in undulating patterns. Twin ridged prongs set atop its eyeless mask probe and search along the ground, perceptive of disturbances in grains of sand leagues away. Said to be the harbingers of an arid and torrid age augured by the expanding dunes, only the youngest emerge from the deep to feed and grow. Guides plead their charges to abide that nights in the desert must be spent in silence, lest they wake the mothers, ripened by millenia, that sleep beneath the crystalline sand.

The Wandering Son of the Mountain Pale, emaciated, and long-limbed. Hunched over at the waist with primordial shale protruding from its skin. The Wandering Son carries an old oak as a club and attacks caravans and cattle that wander too deep into the mountain. In nearby villages, children are told that the moanings of the wind at night are the cries of the Wandering Son. He weeps for the loss of his siblings, the great kingdom of his people, and his pitiful fate as brigand and devourer of humankind.
